# ART Syntax Highlighter
## Description
The **ART Syntax Highlighter** provides syntax highlighting support for the **Ambiguity Retained Translation (ART)** language, a software language engineering tool developed by **Dr. Adrian Johnstone** at **Royal Holloway, University of London.**

This extension was created to **simplify the use of ART**, improving code readability and debugging by applying distinct styles to ART-specific keywords, operators, grammar rules, and semantics. It was developed during the **CS3480: Software Language Engineering** module.

## Features
- **Keyword Highlighting**:
Highlights ART-specific keywords to improve readability and understanding of core language constructs.

- **Operator Recognition**:
Colors mathematical and logical operators distinctly to differentiate them from other code elements.

- **Grammar & Semantics Differentiation**:
Highlights Context-Free Grammar (CFG) rules, reduction rules, and attribute-action rules to clarify the structure of ART programs.

- **Comment Styling**:
Detects and highlights both single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`(* ... *)`) comments in a consistent style.

## Usage
1. **Install the Extension**:
    - Open VS Code and search for "ART Syntax Highlighter" in the Extensions Marketplace.
2. **Open an ART File**:
    - Create or open a file with the `.art` extension to see the syntax highlighting in action.
3. **Customize Colors**:
    - The extension uses default colors for readability, but you can customize colors in the VS Code settings or by modifying the `themes/art-theme-colour.json` file.
